# Math Card Game
Use numbers and mathematical symbols to beat your opponent down!
(Be careful with the beating, this project still needs work)

# Developed with:
1. React
2. HTML5 Drag-and-Drop API

# Motivation
I was just starting to get into React and had never used the HTML5 Drag-and-Drop API so why not.

Growing up, I always loved card games (Yu-Gi-Oh anyone?) so at some point I want to develop my own card game

and this was somewhat the first step towards that...
