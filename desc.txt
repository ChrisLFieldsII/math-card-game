- 5 cards in hand at a time
- cards are:
    - 1-9
    - math symbols (+, -, *, /)
- game directions:
    - at start of every turn, game gives each player 5 cards: 3 numbers and 2 symbols chosen at random. User 
        has to click and drag these cards to come up with one number. Highest number wins.
    - both players lay cards down in left to right order
    - total calculated and round given to winner
    - both players put cards in graveyard and draw 5 more
    - no symbols allowed at first and last slots
    - card holder id naming convention:
        - [(T/B)(fr/br)(Y/N)(#)]
        - [(Top/Bottom)(front row/back row)(symbol allowed? Yes/No)(card number: 1-5)]
        - Ex: TfrY1
            - Top player, front row, card is a symbol, first card in hand

To DO Later:
    - implement colored card holders that indicate which card can go into which cardholder
    - figure out what causes error on drag-drop

Bugs:
    - can illegally place number on top of symbol in front row

Left Off On:
    - clicking player icon throws error
